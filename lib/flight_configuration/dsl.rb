module FlightConfiguration
  # Provides convention over the mechanism provided in `BaseDSL`.
  #
  # The application embedding `DSL` is expected to define a `Flight` module
  # containing the following module methods.
  #
  # * `Flight.root`:  Return the (String) path to the "root" of the filesystem.
  #
  #   When deployed as part of the openflighthpc packages, this is likely to
  #   be the value of the `flight_ROOT` environment variable, often
  #   `/opt/flight`.  During development, this is likely to be the root of the
  #   applications source code checkout.
  #
  #   Relative paths for configuration files are relative to this path.  E.g.,
  #   the configuration file at the relative path `etc/my-app.yaml` might
  #   resolve to either `/opt/flight/etc/my-app.yaml` or
  #   `/home/fligth/code/my-app/etc/my-app.yaml`, depending on the value of
  #   `Flight.root`.
  #
  # * `Flight.env`: Return the (String) environment name.
  #
  #   Typically, `production` or `development`.  Used to determine which
  #   configuration files are loaded.
