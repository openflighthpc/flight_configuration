# FlightConfiguration

`flight_configuration` is a configuration library designed for
`flight-user-suite` and `flight-web-suite`.

Those two suites have some unusual requirements for the installation
mechanisms that they support including configuration.
`flight_configuration` is designed to abstract those requirements.

If you are developing an application that is not part of
`flight-user-suite` or `flight-web-suite` you are likely better off with
some other configuration library, perhaps
[tty-config](https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-config).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'flight_configuration'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install flight_configuration

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
